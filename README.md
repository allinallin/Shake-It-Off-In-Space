## Inspiration
This app is part of a proposal series that heavily encourages entertainment professionals to constantly embrace new technologies as a way of boosting fan engagement.

This particular example features Taylor Swift and her hit single, *Shake It Off*.

## Setup
Can be run on a basic web server. Uses grunt and bower for task and file management. After installing the necessary grunt components, the command `grunt serve` will build the app and open in the default web browser, watching for any changes.

### Restrictions:
The audio folder and files were intentionally left out of the `media` folder. They are required to run the app. Refer to the shared assets folder on Dropbox.
